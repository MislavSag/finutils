}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector for which the SMA is calculated.}

\item{n}{Window size (number of observations) used for the SMA calculation.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as `x` containing the SMA values.
}
\description{
Computes the Simple Moving Average (SMA) for the numeric vector `x` using
a window of size `n`. For indices with insufficient data points, NA is returned.
